## My process

- At first, I linked the `style.css` file and the Google Fonts CDN with `index.html`.
- Then, imported the colors from `style-guide.md` into the `style.css` file. After that, I initialized the css file and set necessary parameters (such as, font-families, colours, font-sizes etc.) for this project.
- Then, I wrote necessary code to reach the given _UI Design Sample_ and also added necessary css styles to match it with the _UI Design Sample_.
- Finally, I wrote the necessary CSS MEDIA QUERIES for mobile device view of this project.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

- By doing this project, I just recaped the CSS GRID.

### Useful resources

- [100 CSS Box Shadow Examples - HTMLCSSFreebies](https://htmlcssfreebies.com/css-box-shadow-examples/) - From here, I got the box shadows.
